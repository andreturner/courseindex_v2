      <h1>Interactive Album Cover by Weidi</h1>
      <p>Before we started our Parametrics project, I had never once used Javascript or heard of p5js. After some research, I stumbled upon a few designers on Youtube 
        who had made coding tutorials. One of these designers is Weidi Zhang. She is based in LA and currently works in experimental data visualization, speculative design, 
        responsive intelligence systems and immersive media. Her tutorials are based on both 2D and 3D visualizations. Although I found the code a bit too challenging to 
        understand as a beginner, I enjoyed watching her process and she worked through the creation of the album cover.
