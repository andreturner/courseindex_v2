          <h1>Assignment 1 - Confounding tools</h1>
          
          <p>Overall, the process of finding new tools and experimenting with how to use them was simultaeneously fun and difficult. 
            I spent much of the first week looking for tools before having a real concept so they did not grab my interest and i did not
             end up making much. Once I did come up with one and eventually a few concepts, I found that the work flowed much more 
             easily. Although I tried to use tools such as LibreOffice and Google Docs to make my collages, I found their processes much
              too limiting and ended up mostly using Photopea for image placement, along with a variety of other programs that I used to
               add filters to my images. If I were to do this project again, I would like to try other programs that were not so similar to Photoshop 
               as Photopea was to challenge myself a bit more. I believe that if i were to think of concept before I began the experimentation phase,
                I would have been less frustrated with my experiments.
