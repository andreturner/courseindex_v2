      <h1> Icebreaker</h1>

      <p>1. In the documentary, Karim Rashid asks the question “Why should things be made to last?”, implying that maybe designers should be making 
        ephemeral objects instead. I disagree with this notion. I think that good design should have a sense of permanence. There is an eventuality of thing
         being thrown away but, the aim should be to make things that are functional over time and can then be recycled. In 2022 one of society’s largest 
         issues is global warming and a big contribution to this is pollution because of the fact that so much of what we use is meant to be thrown away
        quickly. Designers need to compensate for this by making things that last.</p>
        
        <p>Something that I do agree with from the film is how Naoto Fukasawa describes the Japanese design sensibility. He compares it to haiku, 
          stating that what is present is stated simply and plainly, and it is up to the audience to fill in the gaps with their imagination. I think good design 
          should be efficient, but that it should also make you curious - it will naturally make you wonder how it was made and what is is trying to 
        communicate.</p>
        
       <p> 2. The designs that I always respond the most to are those that are simple, iconic, and functional. I think that good design needs to be simple 
         enough to be accessible to a large audience of people but, that it should carry weight - whether that be through how it piques curiosity, or by how
          it makes the audience feel. In my work, I try to use a simple idea but then abstract it or expand on it in a way that makes it more interesting. 
          Often this does not happen right away but, I will think about something for a while, try to work on it, set it aside and then go back to it multiple
           times. In this way, I am able to get a new perspective.</p>
        
        <p>3. What I like about graphic design is that there are many avenues you can take to express an idea, whether that be through photography, 
          collage, video or typography. This variety keeps it fresh to me. I have always enjoyed looking at the cover art for things such as manga and video 
          games. I loved how each one had their own personality - it made me want to create my own.</p>

       <h1>Tool Standards and Poetics</h1>

       <p>1. In the John-Patrick Hartnett article, he explains that the design world is subject to a hegemony that is enforced by the dominance of Apple 
         and Adobe. These products have become the standard for professional designers. The problem that he illustrates, is that these companies buy 
         out their competition and give designers little choice in terms of what tools they are able to use to design. Since the beginning of modernism, 
         artists and designers have had a deep connection with their tools both in terms of how they function and how they are used. This is not the case 
         with Apple and Adobe, as they are made by tech specialists and not necessarily designers, and thus designers are locked out of the making 
         process of their own tools. He suggests that open-source software could be a form of resistance against these big companies, as designers are 
         more involved in both how they are made and so have better knowledge of how they function. This making process in turn also gives designers 
         the power to be able to communicate their needs to Apple and Adobe, and possibly be able to shape the future of these products for their own 
         sake.</p>

        <p>Becca Abbe describes how since the 1980s, people have been trying to move away from centralized systems of power to form their own 
          communities. This started with the findings of the Club of Rome, who stated to the UN that the world's resources would be used up in the near 
          future if the current rates of consumption were to continue. Environmentalists reacted to this with outrage and demanded that the system that 
          was depleting the world's resources be overturned. Later, Masanobu Fukuoka suggested that people could make their own individual farms which
           would do less damage to the environment. In our day and age, the usage of the WWW consumes 10% of all production in the world and is steadily 
           increasing. Systems essential to our modern lives such as the Cloud are actually hosted by the computers of big corporations and these computers
            take up a lot of physical space, meaning they use a lot of energy. Companies like Low Tech run their website with the use of a single computer 
            powered by solar energy and therefore, take up much less space than a big company would to store information.</p> 

          <p>Both of these articles suggest that their respective communities should take control of the resources that they require to allow them to 
            function, and form decentralized networks as a form of resistance against the dominant power. While in the Hartnett article he suggests the 
            making and use of open source software, the Abbe article suggests that people form peer-to-peer networks to share information - this is the 
            way the WWW functioned in the first place. The commonality between them is that people in these communities should have more control over
             the systems that they use.</p>

          <p>2. In the Abbe article she mentions Masanobu Fukuoka's "One Straw Revolution" and how it describes ways in which individuals can essentially
             create their own farms and do no harm to the environment. We continue to use traditional farms, thus harming the environment. While not everyone
              will adopt Fukuoka's direction, it will be our job as designers in the present and future to call attention to the harm that is being done to promote 
              change. What we design will also have to change. It will have to take into account that the growing population and global warming are depleting 
              our resources and move towards using more renewable, environmentally friendly resources.</p>

              <h1>Code, letters, logic, play</h1>

              <p>This is a poster by Dutch designer Hansje van Halem for Galerie Block C. I was introduced to the work of Hansje through watching the 
                "Math, Logic, Design?" video lecture. To my understanding, Hansje was a designer who used coding languages to express typographic form 
                through the use of geometric pattern - this is exactly what I found interesting about the poster.  There is a lot of variation and depth in the
                pattern (both in the background and in the letters themselves) and I marvelled at the possibility of being able to accomplish something like
                this with code. The letters seem to vibrate against themselves and against the background, and the colours give the poster a vibrant yet
                 calming feel.</p>

              <p>This is how Hansje created the poster:</p>

              <p>
              - she found a typeface
              - typed the words she wanted to use on illustrator
              - created a pattern for the background
              - created a pattern that overlaid the text
              - chose the colours for both patterns
              - printed a preliminary colour layer of the poster with a risograph
              - printed a secondary colour layer on top of the already printed risograph
              </p>

             <p> Rather than completely relying on digital processes like I thought she had done, Hansje used both digital and analog processes to achieve 
               the 3D effect of her poster.</p>

               <h1>Olia Lialina — Turing Complete User & Laurel Schwulst — My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge...</h1>

               <p>1. Olia Lialina’s description of the universal is empowering, especially in terms of the way she describes this type of interaction with 
                 the computer as “the ultimate experience”. Through liaising with both hardware, software, and repurposing the functionalities of programs, 
                 the user gains autonomy. I agree with this notion that users should be knowledgable of how their computer works and how to manipulate it 
                 to their needs. Since there are a plethora of applications available online, it is not always necessary or even preferable to use ones such as 
                 Facebook or Twitter. Laurel Schwulst describes these platforms as having the potential to have a harmful effect on mental health. These big 
                 corporations place a higher emphasis on advertisements than their user’s needs and with this in mind, users should not feel compelled to 
                 limit themselves to these platforms. To create individual websites then using classic markup languages as Schwulst describes, is exactly the
                  type of behaviour that a universal user would be engaging in. By learning to code, they are given control over how their website will function,
                   what it will look and feel like, and a greater understanding of the web and its inner workings at large.</p>

                <p>2. Although, some aspects of the way I use my computer does coincide with that of a universal user, I am not a universal user I tend to use
                   many typical apps and platforms for their intended purposes although, there are a few exceptions. Like Lialina, I open both Safari and Chrome
                    at the same time and use them for different functions - Safari I set as my default browser and open tabs where I do not need to move from
                     page to page; in Chrome I do most of my research. Also, if I need to write something I will use the “Notes” app to make an outline before 
                     finalizing it in whatever program I need to make the final copy in. I see the way I see the computer as akin to a relationship with a friend. 
                     There are constantly new things to learn about your friend and through the way you think and interact, about yourself as well. The things 
                     that you research and what you make are like conversations; there is a constant need to refine what you are saying and through feedback,
                      you get to the core of an idea.</p>
